This project was fun, as it was a class project for my UI class in undergrad. Although, it is very ugly, I did learn a lot about JS, HTML, CSS, and how not to manage a project with git. 

My team and I were able to get shopping items neatly displayed, and added to a cart. Though the colors chosen were quite ugly, we had a great presentation and ultimately achieved an A for the project.

This was a project in which there was little to no guidance in how to go about it, so it was a challenge figuring out which tools to use.
