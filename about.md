## A bit about me,

I've been coding since high school, when I discovered I could dual boot Linux and Windows. But my curiousity was sparked early on when I played the PS1 and Dreamcast. I used to wonder what it took to make my controller speak to my gaming console, update the image on my TV, all in a responsive way.

Video games have been my hobby since I can remember. I love talking about them, following the state of the industry, and of course playing them. I am currently learning Godot and C++ to program my own games.

When I'm not sitting in the front of the computer, I am usually sitting in front of the TV watching NFL or College football. 

On the opposite end of the spectrum, I fell in love with distance running in high school. Though I don't run nearly as much as I used to, I still enjoy a long run. You can connect with me on Strava if you'd like.
